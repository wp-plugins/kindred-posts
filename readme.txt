Automatically recommend your posts to your site visitors

== Description ==

Kindred Posts learns how your website visitors are currently using your site and uses artificial intelligence to recommend posts that your visitors may find the most interesting to them.

This easy-to-use plugin requires almost no setup. All you have to do is activate the plugin and drag-and-drop a widget into your theme to start recommending posts. Kindred Posts handles all the rest. If you want more control over the look and feel, you can modify the templates packaged with the plugin or call the PHP code itself.

= Kindred Posts Premium =
Kindred Posts is going open source and we will soon offer our premium version with additional features for free! The premium version includes:

* More options that control the look and feel of your widgets
* More control over visit data
* Integration with Google Analytics

If you like our plugin or appreciate our work, please consider donating! It will help keep the lights on and the coffee/code brewing.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'kindred-posts' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory

3. Navigate to Appearance > Widgets to drag and drop the Kindred Posts widget into your theme
4. Navigate to Settings > Kindred Posts to set global settings and see information about the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How long after setting up the plugin does it take to recommend content? =

Once you drop the Kindred Posts widget into your theme, your website visitors will start seeing recommended posts immediately. Your recommendations will become more targeted as more visitors navigate through your website and the plugin has a chance to learn about how visitors use your website.

= What is Test Mode? =

Test mode takes all Kindred Posts widgets currently in your theme offline and feeds some fake data into the recommendation engine so you can see how the plugin looks to your visitors. While the plugin is in test mode, you can still collect data about how visitors are accessing your website and use that data to make recommendations once Test Mode is disabled.

= What is the "theme" directory? =

The "theme" directory allows you to control how different aspects of the plugin are displayed. If you know some PHP, you can customize how the widget is displayed within your theme using custom-templates.php. For more information, please refer to that file and templates.php within the "theme" directory. If you have any questions about customizing the widget, please ask them on our [forum](http://AiSpork.com/forums/).
