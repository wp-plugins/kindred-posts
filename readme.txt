Use artificial intelligence to recommend content to your site visitors

== Description ==

Kindred Posts uses artificial intelligence to learn how your website visitors use your site and recommends content based on their interests.

This easy-to-use plugin requires almost no setup. You simply activate the plugin and drag a widget into your theme to start recommending content. Kindred Posts handles the rest! If you want more control over the look and feel, you can modify the templates packaged with the plugin or call the PHP code itself.

One of Kindred Posts' newest features is the ability to integrate with your website analytics. From the settings page, you can now add tracking code that allows you to see what recommendations are being read.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How long after setting up the plugin does it take to recommend content? =

Once you drop the Kindred Posts widget into your theme, your website visitors will start seeing recommended posts immediately. Your recommendations will become more targeted as more visitors navigate through your website and the plugin has a chance to learn about how visitors use your website.

= What is Test Mode? =

Test mode takes all active Kindred Posts widgets offline and feeds some fake data into the recommendation engine so you can see how the plugin looks to your visitors. While the plugin is in test mode, you can still collect data about how visitors are accessing your website and use that data to make recommendations once Test Mode is disabled.

= What is the "theme" directory? =

The "theme" directory allows you to control how different aspects of the plugin are displayed. If you know HTML and some PHP, you can customize how the widget is displayed within your theme using custom-templates.php. For more information, please refer to that file and templates.php within the "theme" directory. If you have any questions about customizing the widget, please ask them on our [forum](http://AiSpork.com/forums/), we are more than happy to help you out.
